** This repo has been moved ! **

I might keep pushing to this github repo, but upstream is now:

  https://git.onna.be/parteye/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# parteye.py #

Acts as a glue between [zbar](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/) and
[Partkeepr](https://www.partkeepr.org/).  
A good way of repurpose an old webcam !

For now it only works with [TME](https://www.tme.eu/), the polish electronics
parts distributor.  On their orders, they place a little QR code on each
package with some info. With that and the distributor's API ... no need to type
anymore !

I'll probably extend it to work with [Farnell/Element14](http://farnell.com) if
I place an order soon, as they too have a reasonably good API and maybe they do
something similar with their packages

# requirements #

As far as I know, python3 and [requests
](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library.

# usage #

First configure the thing. Create a file named `config.ini` in the same folder
as the script. It should look like this:

```
[tme]
token = your_tme_api_token
secret = your_tme_api_secret

[partkeepr]
user = your_pk_username
pwd = your_pk_password
url = http://your_pk_url

```

And then basically, pass the output of zbar to the script via pipe:

```
zbarcam --raw /dev/video0 | ./parteye.py
```

On [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) you may need a little bit of
tweaking because of zbar ...:

```
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libv4l/v4l1compat.so zbarcam --raw /dev/video0 | ./parteye.py
```

# notes #

The script places the new part under a category at root level named `00 - QR-reader`.
For the location uses one named _"Sense-Ordenar"_.  
You can change that on request.json.

Partkeepr API doc is literally non-existent ... So if you want to tweak this,
you'll have to make good use of _Developer tools_ on your browser.
